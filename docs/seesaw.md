# SeeSaw

Seesaw is an open source microcontroller friend for other chips. It provides a variety of capabilities such as UART, ADC, DAC, extra GPIO, etc. to chips that donâ€™t have them.

### Installing SeeSaw onto Robo HAT MM1

1. Download the latest release from Adafruit SeeSaw (TBC), looking for robohatmm1 uf2 in your correct language:
https://github.com/adafruit/seesaw

2. Connect the Robo HAT MM1 to your computer's USB port.  

3. Double Press the "Reset" button quickly, the LED should start to pulse and a ROBOBOOT drive will appear on your computer.

4. Copy the robohatmm1 uf2 firmware file onto the USB.

5. The board will reset and CircuitPython is successfully installed.


## Getting Started with SeeSaw

Adafruit has a tutorial for using [SeeSaw on a Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-seesaw-atsamd09-breakout/raspberry-pi-wiring-test).  This is a good starting point for those wanting to learn how SeeSaw works.
