# Robo HAT MM1
The Robotics Masters Robo HAT MM1 is an open source robotics controller board for Raspberry Pi. It is education focused but works in many applications. The Robo HAT provides all the hardware you need in one simple, easy-to-use form factor. It removes the initial barriers to starting any robotics project.

With support for Adafruit CircuitPython, Arduino IDE, and other libraries the Robo HAT is able to act as a single solution for all projects great and small.

This is the starting point for anyone who has the Robo HAT MM1 and is looking to build great projects!

## Select a Firmware

Depending on what you are doing, you will want to select the right Firmware.  There are currently three different options.

* CircuitPython:  Donkey Car (RC Control), IMU Robot Arm, Sensors
* SeeSaw: ArduPilot, Donkey Car (no RC control), Voice Robot Arm
* Arduino IDE: backwards support for sensors

### Installing CircuitPython onto Robo HAT MM1

1. Download the latest release from Adafruit CircuitPython, looking for robohatmm1 uf2 in your correct language:
https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases

2. Connect the Robo HAT MM1 to your computer's USB port.  

3. Double Press the "Reset" button quickly, the LED should start to pulse and a ROBOBOOT drive will appear on your computer.

4. Copy the robohatmm1 uf2 firmware file onto the USB.

5. The board will reset and CircuitPython is successfully installed.

### Installing SeeSaw onto Robo HAT MM1

1. Download the latest release from Adafruit SeeSaw (TBC), looking for robohatmm1 uf2 in your correct language:
https://github.com/adafruit/seesaw

2. Connect the Robo HAT MM1 to your computer's USB port.  

3. Double Press the "Reset" button quickly, the LED should start to pulse and a ROBOBOOT drive will appear on your computer.

4. Copy the robohatmm1 uf2 firmware file onto the USB.

5. The board will reset and CircuitPython is successfully installed.
