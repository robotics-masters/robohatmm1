# Robo HAT MM1

![Robo HAT MM1 image](robohatmm1.png)

The Robotics Masters Robo HAT MM1 is an open source robotics controller board for Raspberry Pi. It is education focused but works in many applications. The Robo HAT provides all the hardware you need in one simple, easy-to-use form factor. It removes the initial barriers to starting any robotics project.

With support for Adafruit CircuitPython, Arduino IDE, and other libraries the Robo HAT is able to act as a single solution for all projects great and small.

This is the starting point for anyone who has the Robo HAT MM1 and is looking to build great projects!
