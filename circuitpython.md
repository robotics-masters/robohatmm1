# CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a special programming language developed by Adafruit that is based on Python but focused purely on writing code for hardware. It has many thousands of libraries for different sensors. It makes programming motors, servos, sensors and other bits easy. CircuitPython doesnâ€™t require any software on your computer - it runs natively on supported boards and appears as a USB drive.
