# CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a special programming language developed by Adafruit that is based on Python but focused purely on writing code for hardware. It has many thousands of libraries for different sensors. It makes programming motors, servos, sensors and other bits easy. CircuitPython doesnâ€™t require any software on your computer - it runs natively on supported boards and appears as a USB drive.

## Installing CircuitPython onto Robo HAT MM1

1. Download the latest release from Adafruit CircuitPython, looking for robohatmm1 uf2 in your correct language:
https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases

2. Connect the Robo HAT MM1 to your computer's USB port.  

3. Double Press the "Reset" button quickly, the LED should start to pulse and a ROBOBOOT drive will appear on your computer.

4. Copy the robohatmm1 uf2 firmware file onto the USB.

5. The board will reset and CircuitPython is successfully installed.
